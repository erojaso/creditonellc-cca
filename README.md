### Business case

Credit One is a credit risk rating company, its '**business partners**' use their services to identify possible risks in the profile of one of their clients prior to granting a loan.
Recently, Credit One has seen an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans granted by their business partners, and Credit One as a credit rating could risk losing business if the problem is not resolved correctly.
